      <h2>Knitting is</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Using interlocking loops to create fabric</li>
        <li>A descriptor of the fabric during creation</li>
        <li>A hobby of mine since 2001</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Knitting used to be considered an activity for older ladies. Now it's more <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/">widespread</a> and knitters can be found in every demographic. It can be as easy or difficult, as affordable or pricey as you want.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I'd pick a fairly easy project and knit while walking. When that walking is done at San Diego Comic-Con, it can make for <a href="photo_opps.html">interesting photo opportunities</a>.</p>
