      <p>Knitting used to be considered an activity for older ladies. Now it's more <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/">widespread</a> and knitters can be found in every demographic. It can be as easy or difficult, as affordable or pricey as you want.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Sometimes I'd pick a fairly easy project and knit while walking. When that walking is done at San Diego Comic-Com, it can make for <a href="photo_opps.html">interesting photo opportunities</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.knittersreview.com/default.asp">Knitter's Review</a> is a great resource for knitters. The layout is well-defined and you can explore different areas from the top nav area.</p>
